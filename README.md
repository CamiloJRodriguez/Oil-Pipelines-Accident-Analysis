## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code was developed on the Google Collaboratory platform in python 3 along with the libraries that it already has installed, being applicable in Anaconda. The libraries used were:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
* Yellowbrick

yellowbrick, it may happen that this library is not installed so it must be installed by pip [here](https://pypi.org/project/yellowbrick/)

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Oil Pipeline Accidents database (2010-2017) from Department of Transportation of USA to better understand:

1. Do companies learn from their accidents? (Accidents o experiences of other companies)
2. Does the fluid type influence accidents? or the cause? or both?
3. Which operator has caused the most accidents? What is the operator that has generated the most costs?
4. What is the participation of the environmental costs over the total costs? What has been the most impacted city in the environmental aspect?

With this project I hope to learn why oil accidents occur and generate knowledge to combat them.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are one notebook: 'Oil_Pipeline_Accidents_2010-2017 - Camilo_Jimenez'. In this notebook I enumerate the big steps: 
1. Context
2. Import libraries
3. Load Datasets
4. Data Description an Cleaning
5. Questions
6. Data Description an Cleaning (Continue)
7. Transformations 
8. Modeling
Each step use Markdowns to guide in reading and undestanding process of my analysis

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The analysis and findings are in the following post [here](https://medium.com/@camilo7456_88506/is-it-possible-to-avoid-accidents-in-oil-pipelines-311574862870).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Department of Transportation for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/pipeline-accidents).  Given my learning process with Udacity around data science and for which I am grateful, feel free to give me recommendations that allow me to continue growing as a data scientist, any concern or appreciation will be well received!
